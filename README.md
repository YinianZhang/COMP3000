# Pet management center system
# Project Introduction
In nowadays society, many families or individuals have pets no matter which country. However, when families or individuals do not have free time and energy to look after pets, it may only be for a short period. These pets may be placed in another family for care or can only be locked in and left unattended. Therefore, the pet foster care management system is a foster care system that can help families or individuals who do not have free time and energy to look after their pets.
